# A‚≠ê Pathfinding Algorithm

The famous [A* / A-Star Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), implemented in [P5JS](https://p5js.org/).

It is one of the most efficient Pathfinding-Algorithms. Think of it as a  optimized [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm).
The difference is that Dijkstra's algorithm expands in every direction, while A* / A-Star knows where the End-Node is and optimizes it's pathfinding towards that End Node. Therefor, it won't visit "unnecessairy" Nodes on it's way to the End-Node.
