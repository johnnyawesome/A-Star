# A-Star

The famous [A* / A-Star Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), implemented in P5JS.

It is one of the most efficient Search-Algorithms. Think of it as a  optimized [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm).
THe difference is that Dijkstra's algorithm expands in every direction. A* / A-Star has a sense of direction and won't visit unnecessairy Nodes.
